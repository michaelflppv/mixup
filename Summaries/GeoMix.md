# Paper 5 - Graph Mixup on Approximate Gromov‚ÄìWasserstein Geodesics

## 1. Introduction

**Motivation:**  
- **Mixup Success in Euclidean Data:**  
  Mixup‚Äîcreating synthetic training samples by linear interpolation of input‚Äìlabel pairs‚Äîhas shown to enhance model generalization in vision and NLP.
- **Graph Data Challenges:**  
  Graphs are non-Euclidean, lie in disparate spaces, vary in size, and are often not well-aligned. These characteristics make a straightforward application of Euclidean mixup unsuitable.
- **Sample‚ÄìLabel Consistency Issue:**  
  Existing graph mixup approaches often transform graphs into embeddings or other aligned forms, yet many transformations are not equivalence-preserving, leading to inconsistent sample‚Äìlabel pairs.
  
**Proposed Solution (GEOMIX):**  
- **Core Idea:**  
  GEOMIX proposes to perform mixup along the geodesics in the Gromov‚ÄìWasserstein (GW) space. By mapping graphs into a joint space via equivalence-preserving transformations (EPT), the method defines a GW geodesic between two graphs.
- **Key Guarantee:**  
  Linear interpolation in this well-aligned GW space guarantees that the synthetic samples are consistent with their labels.
- **Efficiency:**  
  To reduce the high computational cost of exact GW geodesics, the authors introduce an accelerated algorithm that approximates the geodesics in a low-dimensional setting.

## 2. Preliminaries

**Notations and Graph Representation:**  
- Matrices: **A**, vectors: **s**, sets: *ùí¢*, scalars: *Œ±*.  
- A graph is represented as:  
  $$ G = (A, \mu) $$  
  where $$A \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times n}$$ (adjacency matrix) and $$\mu \in \Delta_n$$ (node weight with $$\Delta_n = \{ \mu \in \mathbb{R}_+^n \mid \sum_{i=1}^{n} \mu(i)=1 \}$$).

**Standard Graph Mixup:**  
- In Euclidean settings, mixup is defined as:  
  $$
  \begin{aligned}
  x(\lambda) &= (1-\lambda)x_1 + \lambda x_2, \\
  y(\lambda) &= (1-\lambda)y_1 + \lambda y_2.
  \end{aligned}
  $$
- For graphs, due to size and alignment issues, many methods first transform graphs with functions $$\Gamma_1, \Gamma_2$$ and then perform mixup on the transformed representations.

**Gromov‚ÄìWasserstein (GW) Space and Distance:**  
- **GW Distance:**  
  For graphs \(G_1=(A_1, \mu_1)\) and \(G_2=(A_2, \mu_2)\), the \(p\)-GW distance is defined as:
  $$
  d_{GW}(G_1, G_2) = \min_{T \in \Pi(\mu_1, \mu_2)} \left( \sum_{i,j,k,l} \left| A_1(i,j) - A_2(k,l) \right|^p \, T(i,k)\, T(j,l) \right)^{1/p}.
  $$
- **GW Geodesics:**  
  By considering an equivalence relation (i.e., \(G_1 \sim G_2\) if \(d_{GW}(G_1,G_2)=0\)), the induced metric on the space of equivalence classes is defined as:
  $$
  d^*_{GW}(\mathcal{J}_{G_1}, \mathcal{J}_{G_2}) = d_{GW}(G_1, G_2).
  $$
- **Equivalence-Preserving Transformations:**  
  A transformation \(\Gamma\) is equivalence-preserving if for all \(G\) in the graph space, \(G \sim \Gamma(G)\).

**Geodesic Graph Mixup Problem:**  
- **Sample‚ÄìLabel Consistency:**  
  A mixup sample \(\tilde{G}(\lambda)\) and label \(\tilde{y}(\lambda)\) are consistent if the relative distances in the GW space match the interpolation weights.
- **Formal Definition:**  
  The geodesic graph mixup problem seeks a GW geodesic:
  $$
  \gamma(\lambda) = \mathcal{J}_{\tilde{G}(\lambda)}
  $$
  connecting the equivalence classes \(\mathcal{J}_{G_1}\) and \(\mathcal{J}_{G_2}\) so that the interpolation is consistent with the underlying structure and labels.

## 3. Methodology

The methodology is divided into two major parts:

### 3.1 Mixup on Exact GW Geodesics

- **Principled Interpolation:**  
  GEOMIX generalizes Euclidean mixup to graphs by defining the mixup sample as a point along the GW geodesic between two graphs.
- **Construction:**  
  - **Graph Geodesic Representation:**  
    The geodesic is defined via:
    $$
    \begin{aligned}
    \tilde{A}(\lambda) &:= (1-\lambda) A_1 \otimes \mathbf{1}_{n_2 \times n_2} + \lambda \mathbf{1}_{n_1 \times n_1} \otimes A_2, \\
    \tilde{\mu}(\lambda) &= \operatorname{vec}\big(\operatorname{OT}(G_1, G_2)\big),
    \end{aligned}
    $$
    where \(\operatorname{OT}(G_1,G_2)\) is the optimal transport coupling.
  - **Equivalence-Preserving Transformation:**  
    Linear transformations \(P_1\) and \(P_2\) (via Kronecker products) are applied to obtain well-aligned transformed graphs \(\tilde{G}_1\) and \(\tilde{G}_2\).
  - **Final Interpolation:**  
    The mixup graph and its label are obtained by:
    $$
    \begin{aligned}
    \tilde{A}(\lambda) &= (1-\lambda)\tilde{A}_1 + \lambda \tilde{A}_2, \\
    \tilde{\mu}(\lambda) &= (1-\lambda)\tilde{\mu}_1 + \lambda \tilde{\mu}_2, \\
    \tilde{y}(\lambda) &= (1-\lambda)y_1 + \lambda y_2.
    \end{aligned}
    $$

- **Guarantee:**  
  Theorem 3.1 shows that these operations yield a valid GW geodesic, ensuring that the mixup samples are consistent with their labels.

### 3.2 Accelerating Mixup on Approximate GW Geodesics

- **Challenge of High Dimensionality:**  
  Exact GW geodesics operate in a space with dimension proportional to \(n_1 n_2\), which is computationally prohibitive.
- **Low-Rank Approximation:**  
  A hyperparameter \(r\) (with \(r \leq n\)) is introduced to reduce dimensionality.
  - New variables:
    $$
    Q_1 = P_1 \operatorname{diag}(g), \quad Q_2 = P_2 \operatorname{diag}(g),
    $$
    with \(g \in \Delta_r\).
- **Reformulated Optimization:**  
  The problem becomes:
  $$
  \begin{aligned}
  \min_{Q_1, Q_2, g} \quad & \left( \epsilon_{A_1,A_2}\big(Q_1\,\operatorname{diag}(1/g)\,Q_2^T\big) \right)^{\frac{1}{2}} \\
  \text{s.t.} \quad & Q_1 \in \Pi(\mu_1, g), \quad Q_2 \in \Pi(\mu_2, g), \quad g \in \Delta_r.
  \end{aligned}
  $$
- **Optimization via Mirror Descent:**  
  A mirror descent scheme with generalized KL divergence and Dykstra‚Äôs algorithm is used to update \(Q_1\), \(Q_2\), and \(g\) iteratively.
- **Transformation Recovery and Final Output:**  
  Once convergence is reached, the transformation matrices \(P_1\) and \(P_2\) are recovered by column normalization of \(Q_1\) and \(Q_2\). The final mixup graph is then computed similarly to the exact case, but with significantly reduced computational cost.

| **Advantages**                                                                                                              | **Disadvantages / Limitations**                                                                                                                           |
|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Principled Geodesic Interpolation:** Mixup samples are generated along the GW geodesics, ensuring sample‚Äìlabel consistency. | **Computational Overhead in Exact Formulation:** Exact GW geodesics operate in very high-dimensional spaces, which is computationally expensive.          |
| **Equivalence-Preserving Transformations:** Aligns graph structures so that interpolation is meaningful in the GW space.        | **Approximation Trade-off:** The low-rank approximation introduces a hyperparameter \(r\) that must be tuned to balance accuracy and efficiency.          |
| **Accelerated Computation:** The proposed mirror descent scheme with Dykstra‚Äôs algorithm reduces complexity from \(O(n^4)\) to \(O(n^2r)\). | **Model Complexity:** The overall method involves multiple stages (transformation, optimization, projection), increasing implementation complexity.     |
| **Theoretical Guarantees:** The paper provides proofs ensuring that the interpolated samples truly lie on the GW geodesics.         | **Applicability:** Primarily validated for graph classification; extending the method to other graph tasks may require additional adaptation.             |

# Experiments

## 4.1 Understanding the GEOMIX Process

- **Visualization of Mixup Graphs:**  
  GEOMIX is applied on graphs generated by the Stochastic Block Model (SBM) with varying numbers of blocks (2, 3, 5). Mixup samples are generated with different values of \(\lambda\) (0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8), and it is observed that as \(\lambda\) increases, the mixup graph becomes more similar to \(G_2\).

- **Sample‚ÄìLabel Consistency Evaluation:**  
  The ratio 
  \[
  \frac{d_{GW}(\tilde{G}(\lambda), G_1)}{d_{GW}(\tilde{G}(\lambda), G_2)}
  \]
  is compared with 
  \[
  \frac{\|\tilde{y}(\lambda) - y_2\|}{\|\tilde{y}(\lambda) - y_1\|}.
  \]
  GEOMIX achieves a Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.91, which is significantly higher than that of G-Mixup (0.25) and FGWMixup (0.71).  
  Additionally, TSNE visualization of embeddings (using a GCN) on IMDB-B and MUTAG shows that mixup samples lie on a geodesic connecting the original graph pairs.

---

## 4.2 Generalization of GNNs

- **Experimental Setup:**  
  Graph classification is performed on five real-world datasets (PROTEINS, MUTAG, MSRC-9, IMDB-B, IMDB-M) using an 80/10/10 split and 10-fold cross validation. Two GNN models (GCN and GIN) are used as backbones.

- **Comparative Methods:**  
  GEOMIX is compared with eight state-of-the-art graph augmentation methods, including DropEdge, DropNode, Subgraph, M-Mixup, SubMix, G-Mixup, S-Mixup, and FGWMixup.

- **Results:**  
  GEOMIX achieves the best performance on 8 out of 10 settings and second-best on the remaining 2, with an improvement of up to 6.6% over the best competitor. It is particularly effective on datasets with fewer graphs and larger graph sizes (e.g., MUTAG and PROTEINS).

---

## 4.3 Robustness of GNNs

- **Experiment Setup:**  
  Robustness is evaluated under two types of corruption:
  - **Topology Corruption:** Randomly removing/adding 10% or 20% of edges.
  - **Label Corruption:** Randomly changing the labels for 10% or 20% of training graphs.

- **Results:**  
  GEOMIX outperforms competitor methods under both types of corruption. It achieves up to 4.7% improvement against topology corruption and 1.8% improvement against label corruption compared with the best competitor.

---

## 4.4 Effect of Mixup Graph Size

- **Analysis:**  
  The performance of GEOMIX is studied with varying mixup graph sizes (hyperparameter \(r\)).  
  - **Accuracy:** Classification accuracy fluctuates within ¬±3% across different values of \(r\), indicating robust performance.
  - **Efficiency:** The running time increases approximately linearly with \(r\).
  - **Transformation Quality:** Visualizations of the learned transformation matrices show that as \(r\) increases, the matrices become sparser, approximating the exact GW geodesic solution.

| **Robustness Tests and Ablation Studies**   | Provides further robustness evaluations (e.g., under topology and label corruptions) and ablation studies that isolate the effects of different components of GEOMIX.                                | Demonstrates the stability and robustness of GEOMIX across various conditions and reinforces its benefits. |
| **Efficiency and Time Complexity Analyses** | Presents detailed analyses showing that the accelerated GEOMIX achieves a complexity of \(O(n^2r)\) compared to the much higher cost of exact GW geodesics, with experimental runtime results supporting this claim. | Validates that the low-rank approximation yields significant efficiency gains with minimal loss of effectiveness.  |
