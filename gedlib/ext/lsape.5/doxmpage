* \section Content
* <p>Compute optimal correspondances between the elements of
* two sets, i.e. solving bipartite matching problems (aka linear sum assignment problems),
* together with their dual (aka labeling problems). Equivalently, compute dissimilarity measures between two sets, based on optimal correspondances.</p>
*  <p>Solve the following problems:</p>
*    <ul><li>symmetric or assymmetric MIN-LSAP / minimal-cost perfect or maximal bipartite matching</li>
*    <li>MIN-LSAP with Error-correction (LSAPE) / minimal-cost error-correcting bipartite matching</li></ul>
*  <p>with the Hungarian method (each problem is solved by a specific Hungarian algorithm)</p>
*  <p>or compute a cheap assignment with greedy methods.</p>
* <p>More information on <a href="https://bougleux.users.greyc.fr/lsape/">LSAPE</a> website.</p>
* \remarks
* <ul><li>nxm matrices are represented by arrays of size nm (concatenation of the columns)</li>
* <li>optimal solutions (and partial ones) are encoded by arrays of integers (element indicies), negative values (-1) denote unassigned elements</li>
* </ul>
